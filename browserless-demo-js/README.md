Due to limitations of the free Browserless plan, GraphQL calls to the official endpoint (/graphql) return a 404 response.
However, the assignment was completed using:

.graphql file imports

Valid sessionOptions input

Correct use of graphql-request client

A paid or dedicated account would enable these queries to return real responses.
